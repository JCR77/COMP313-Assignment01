# COMP313 - Jack Rodgers - Assignment 1 - AIPerceptron

## Brief game description

In the small game I made to demonstrate the technology I used, I made a game one half pacman, and one half metal gear.
The pacman half is collecting the coins and avoiding the guards, while the metal gear half is the basic sneaking around.
The main actions are sneaking and collecting coins. The hardest part to make was the AIPerceptron, and the most interesting bit is the AIPerceptron. What a suprise.
Developed with Unreal Engine 4
